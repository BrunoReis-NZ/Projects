KeyCodes Display App

Description
A simple web app that dynamically displays keycodes, key values, and key codes when a key is pressed. Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app captures keyboard events and presents the corresponding information in real-time.

Features

Clear Presentation: The information is presented in a clear and organized manner.
Dynamic Styling: Utilizes CSS for styling, making the display visually appealing.

How to Use
Press a Key: The app reacts to key presses, displaying the associated keycodes, key values, and key codes.
Clear Display: The display updates in real-time as you press different keys.

Technologies Used
HTML: Defines the structure of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual presentation for a clean and organized display.
JavaScript: Captures and processes keyboard events to show keycodes dynamically.
